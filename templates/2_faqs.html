      <button class="accordion">What is SalinWiki?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>SalinWiki is a Wiki site which serves as a digital library for different dictionaries of the following Philippine languages: Bicolani, Cebuano, Ilocano, and Tagalog. So far, we've only been able to support four Philippine languages as we fully commit to provide the best online dictionary resource and a platform for a supportive community dedicated to the aforementioned languages. However, we do believe that just as other Wiki sites develop over time through user contributions, SalinWiki's mission of breaking language barriers between filipinos will be fulfilled too as we broaden our support to other Philippine languages and reach the goal of gathering multiple users to assist with our cause.</p>
